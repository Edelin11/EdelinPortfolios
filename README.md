# Hi! I'm Edelin and this is my portfolio.

I created this portfolio with personal projects that I have developed for my personal enjoyment. These projects represent me because they each have a little bit of my personality and about how I like to spend some my time.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

__This is a quick description of the projects.__

### Horoscope:
This is a simple page that asks you for an input and returns a value, your zodiac sign and more.

### Calculator: 
This is a simple web calculator with purple-pink colors.

### Breathe:
Because I enjoy meditation I wanted to create a simple animation that simulates the rhythm of breathing to help you with anxiety or just to feel the present moment.

### Multitasker:
Personally, this is sort of a fun project that I did a long time ago. You can have it in your background and use it as a time manager.

### Matching Cards Game: 
Matching cards game. Try it. It's fun.
